# BST
Practice implementation of a binary search tree. Just like the linked list implementation, however the only difference is the data structure involved (BST vs Linked List).Customers are waiting in line for a restaurant, however they can bribe in order to get in over another person in line. If bribes are the same, then whoever had the bribe first will have priority, and everything bribe equal to it is rejected.
